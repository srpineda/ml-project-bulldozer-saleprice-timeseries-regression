# Machine Learning Project: Bulldozer Sale Price Time Series Regression Problem

* This is an end-to-end machine learning project built with Python that aims to predict the auction sale price of a bulldozer.
* Matplotlib was used for data visualization.
* Pandas was used for data preprocessing (dealing with missing data, parsing dates, and converting categorical data into numbers).
* Scikit-Learn's *RandomForestRegressor* was used during modeling and achieved a root mean squared log error of 0.25 after hyperparameter tuning.
* Check out the project [here](https://github.com/srpineda/ml-project-bulldozer-saleprice-timeseries-regression/blob/main/Bulldozers-SalePrice-TimeSeries-Regression.ipynb).
