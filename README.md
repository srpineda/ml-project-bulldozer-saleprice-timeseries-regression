# Machine Learning Project: Bulldozer Sale Price Time Series Regression Problem

* This is an end-to-end machine learning project built with Python that aims to predict the auction sale price of a bulldozer. This is a time series regression problem.

* Matplotlib was used for data visualization.
* Pandas was used for data preprocessing (dealing with missing data and converting categorical data into numbers).
* Scikit-Learn's *RandomForestRegressor* was used during modeling.
* `RandomizedSearchCV` and `GridSearchCV` were used to tune the model's hyperparameters.
